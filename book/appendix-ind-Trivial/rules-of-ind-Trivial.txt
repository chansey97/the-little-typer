Pie has the rule that every expression with type Trivial is the same
as sole, but if it didn't, we might also have something like:

tgt in Trivial ~> tgt'
mot in (-> Trivial U) ~> mot'
base in (mot' sole) ~> base'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ind-Trivial tgt mot base) synth ~> (the (mot' tgt') (ind-Trivial tgt'
mot' base'))

but we don't need it due to the eta rule for Trivial.

Thanks David Thrane Christiansen.
